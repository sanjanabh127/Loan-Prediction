##  Project Overview
This project aims to **predict loan approval status** based on customer details using **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** â€” a powerful supervised machine learning algorithm.  
It analyzes features like income, loan amount, credit history, and other financial attributes to determine whether a loan should be **approved or rejected**.
